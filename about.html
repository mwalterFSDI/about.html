    <h2>Snowboarder</h2>
        <p>I enjoy snowboarding, I'm not that good at it, I wipe out a lot but I get back up and try again</p>

    <h2>City Boxing</h2>
        <p>I enjoy training at City Boxing.  Although I am a beginner, it is a great workout and within walking distance from my apartment.</p>

    <h2>Chef</h2>
    <p>During the pandemic I have become a novice chef, I subscribed to the meal delivery service Hello Fresh.  Hello Fresh sends uncooked, fresh raw meals with directions on how to prepare.  It really saves a lot of time not having to go to the grocery store. </p>
